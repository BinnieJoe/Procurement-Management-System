# Procurement-Management-System
This program was implemented as part of a short-term course at Woosong BIT, focusing on hands-on C++ practice. It manages basic procurement processes such as adding, deleting, and updating items in a purchase list. The project is divided into multiple .cpp and .h files, organized for better readability and maintenance.
